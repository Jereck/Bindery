# Bindery
Bindery is built with the inspiration of making bookclubs a more accessible option for people. Spawned from the idea
of trying to find a book that both myself and my girlfriend can enjoy, Bindery aims to help bookclubs big and small
explore new books, find common ground amoung readers of various tastes, and so much more.
